# hello-world
This is my first repository in my adventure in the land of version control and development...
I'm a marketer deepening my knowledge of the development world in order to better understand the process and to have a little fun.
I am curious how deep I will go, but at this initial stage feel that I will not go too deep into development, possibly staying in the CSS world or potentially building AMP sites and learning those associated skills. Right now I'm a bit all over the place, but will find my 'happy place' soon and go all in.
Another thing I have discovered is the bedrock version of WordPress and Trellis. At the moment I'm sticking with Local by Flywheel, but see promise there as well another tool I found - Branch. That seems like the complete package and has integration with Gitgub. Nice.
